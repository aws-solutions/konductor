# Changelog

All notable changes to ASDLC Core AI Capabilities will be documented here.

This changelog follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) and
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). Entries are consolidated per release,
not per individual commit.

## [1.0.5] - 2026-10-06

### Fixed

- `update --no-telemetry` now opts a project out for good: it removes the project's telemetry
  record instead of only skipping that one run's write, so a later plain `update` can't quietly
  turn telemetry back on. Pass the new `--enable-telemetry` flag to opt back in.
- If removing that record fails (for example, a read-only `.konductor/` directory), `update` now
  warns about it in both plain-text and `--json` output instead of only printing to stderr, so the
  risk of telemetry silently turning back on is visible.
- `install --no-telemetry` warns the same way when it can't remove an earlier opt-in record,
  instead of only printing to stderr.
- The opt-out removal in both `install --no-telemetry` and `update --no-telemetry` is now
  serialized against a concurrent install or update at the same project, so a telemetry record a
  different harness just wrote can no longer be silently destroyed by a race between reading and
  removing it.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-10-01

### Fixed

- Telemetry now works on Kiro CLI v2 and v3. Before, only Claude Code sent agent usage events.
- `konductor install --harness claude` now sets up telemetry, so Claude-Code-only installs
  report too.
- Each agent run is counted once, even with both a global install (in `$HOME`) and a project
  install. Before, Kiro v3 and Claude Code counted it twice. If your global install is from an
  older version, `konductor install` warns you to run `konductor update --target ~`.
- `--no-telemetry` now turns telemetry off for a project completely: also when the project was
  installed with telemetry on before, and when a global install is present.
- `konductor uninstall` now removes Konductor's Claude Code telemetry hooks. Before, they stayed
  in `.claude/settings.json`.
- Sessions started in a project directory now report when Konductor is installed globally, the
  default. Before, they sent nothing.

### Changed

- A project install now writes its Claude Code telemetry hooks to `.claude/settings.local.json`
  instead of the shared `.claude/settings.json`, and moves any hooks an earlier version put there.
  The hooks carry this machine's paths, so they no longer get committed for teammates. If the
  repository doesn't already ignore the file, it is added to `.git/info/exclude`. A global install
  keeps its hooks in `~/.claude/settings.json`.
- Telemetry now covers only Konductor's own agents (the orchestrators and `k-*` specialists). Your
  own agents, a harness's built-in agents, and sessions with no named agent send nothing.
- Delegations to Konductor agents are reported on every harness, including the name of the
  delegating Konductor agent when the harness provides it.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-09-28

### Security

- Upgraded the `rmcp` dependency of the `skill-lookup` MCP server (`mcp/servers/skill-lookup`)
  from 0.1.5 to 2.1.0, closing four Dependabot alerts against `rmcp`'s Streamable HTTP
  transport: [GHSA-9g45-5xwm-f3wc](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9g45-5xwm-f3wc) (missing
  OAuth resource validation), [GHSA-9pj6-vhgr-3mwh](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-9pj6-vhgr-3mwh)
  (session-table denial-of-service leak), [GHSA-33f5-2c5q-wgwj](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-33f5-2c5q-wgwj)
  (cross-origin redirect header leak), and [GHSA-89vp-x53w-74fx](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-89vp-x53w-74fx)
  (DNS rebinding via unvalidated Streamable HTTP requests). `skill-lookup-mcp` only uses `rmcp`'s
  stdio transport, so none of these four issues were reachable through this server's own
  deployment, but the fixed version is required to clear the Dependabot alerts regardless.

### Testing

- Added shakedown test coverage for the `skill-lookup` MCP server's handshake, `find_skills`,
  `get_skill`, and `reload_skills` handlers, plus full-tool-surface coverage, exercising the
  upgraded `rmcp` 2.1.0 integration.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-23

### Added

- 8 specialist agents (product manager, architect, developer, QA, researcher, technical program
  manager, browser, media analyzer) plus three orchestrators (`konductor`,
  `konductor-mux-orchestrator`, `konductor-cmux-orchestrator`) that coordinate them across the
  SDLC, delegating work, tracking progress, and enforcing a maker-checker quality gate on every
  handoff.
- 82 skills across 8 capability areas: architecture and design, planning and tracking,
  architecture and development review, testing and QA, orchestration and delegation, Kiro spec
  generation, documentation and writing, and research and security.
- 19 agent-sops, invoked as `/prompts` entries in Kiro CLI and as `/sop-<name>` skills in Claude
  Code, covering design doc creation, code review, E2E test
  generation, and a full end-to-end SDLC pass (`k-full-sdlc`).
- Persistent memory: a local, cross-session scratchpad under `.konductor/memory/` that needs no
  setup, with a validator enforcing size limits and an optional URL allowlist.
- Multi-runtime support for Kiro CLI v2, Kiro CLI v3, Kiro IDE, and Claude Code.
- The `konductor` CLI with `install`, `update`, `uninstall`, `synth`, `init`, and `doctor`  
  subcommands.
- A `skill-lookup` MCP server that works with Kiro CLI v2, Kiro CLI v3, and Kiro IDE.
