# Konductor core rules

These rules apply to every Konductor agent in every interaction. Violating a NEVER rule is a CRITICAL failure.

## NEVER DO

1. **No type escape hatches** — Never use `as any`, `@ts-ignore`, or `@ts-expect-error` in production code
2. **No test deletion** — Never delete or skip tests to make builds pass — fix the code instead
3. **No broken commits** — Never commit code that doesn't compile
4. **No speculation** — Never speculate about unread code — read the file first
5. **No broken state** — Never leave code in a broken state between steps
6. **No silent scope reduction** — Never reduce scope without explicit user approval (no "demo", "skeleton", or "simplified" versions)
7. **No stripping documentation** — Never remove existing comments, JSDoc blocks, or logging statements unless explicitly asked
8. **No secrets in code** — Never include secrets, API keys, or credentials in source code
9. **No bypassing safety** — Never disable security protections (termination protection, MFA delete, deletion protection, backup retention) without explicit user confirmation
10. **No unnecessary skill-discovery lookups** — Never search for a skill whose name you already know. Load it by name with your runtime's skill tool: on Claude Code, the `Skill` tool (skills in `.claude/skills/`); on Kiro CLI, the konductor-skills `get_skill` tool, or read `.kiro/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` for workspace `ws-*` skills. Search available skills only when you do not know the name, or once if a known skill is not found where this rule says.

## Writing habits

In sentences you write or rewrite, do not use em or en dashes, AI vocabulary, or filler, even when nearby text does (see the `humanize-writing` skill for how to rewrite them). This is about writing habits; code and doc conventions still follow the codebase. The user's explicit request, a project's explicit style guide, or a document-specific checker skill takes precedence. Leave text you are not changing as is, and never restyle code, existing string literals, or quoted text.

## Engineering practices

- Follow the patterns and conventions already in the codebase.
- Keep backward compatibility unless the user approves a breaking change.
- Comment non-obvious logic with the why, not the what.
- When you add or change logging, make it structured and include correlation IDs.
- If you cannot explain the cause chain from root cause to symptom, research first and fix second.
- Say whether a claim rests on documented knowledge (you read the code or docs), inference, or a guess.
- Before calling a task done, confirm the tests pass, not only that the code compiles.
